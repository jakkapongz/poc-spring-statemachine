### **README for Spring Boot State Machine Experiment**

---

#### **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates how to control application states using **Spring Boot State Machine**. We implemented a system with three main states (`STANDBY`, `CONNECTING_TO_EX`, `LIVE`) and ensured that messages are processed only in the **LIVE** state. Messages sent in other states are rejected globally using a filter or an AOP-based solution.

---

#### **States and Events**

- **States**:
    1. **STANDBY**: The system is inactive and awaiting a connection to external services.
    2. **CONNECTING_TO_EX**: The system is attempting to establish a connection to external services.
    3. **LIVE**: The system is fully operational and ready to process messages.

- **Events**:
    1. **STANDBY**: Transition the system to `STANDBY` mode.
    2. **CONNECTING_TO_EX**: Begin the process of connecting to external services.
    3. **LIVE**: Transition to `LIVE` mode, allowing the system to handle messages.

#### **Implemented Features**

1. **State Machine Configuration**:  
   The state machine was set up to handle transitions between the defined states. Events trigger state changes such as moving from `STANDBY` to `CONNECTING_TO_EX`, and eventually to `LIVE`.

2. **Message Handling Logic**:  
   Messages are accepted and processed only when the system is in the `LIVE` state. If the system is in any other state, the message is rejected with an appropriate response.

3. **Global Message Filtering**:  
   We implemented a **Spring filter** to globally intercept incoming requests and reject them if the system is not in the `LIVE` state. The filter improves maintainability by removing the need to add state checks in each controller method.

4. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**:  
   An **AOP aspect** was added to handle state validation for specific controller methods. This approach ensures that messages are conditionally processed without modifying the controller logic directly.

5. **Dynamic State Transitioning**:  
   The state machine dynamically handles actions and guards, ensuring that transitions are controlled based on system requirements and conditions.

#### **Technology Stack**

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building and running the application.
- **Spring State Machine**: Manages state transitions and events within the application.
- **Spring Web**: Provides REST API functionality for testing state transitions and message handling.
- **Spring AOP**: Enables the use of aspects to enforce global rules on method execution.
- **Java**: Programming language used to implement the system logic.

#### **How to Run**

1. Clone the project and navigate to the project directory.
2. Build and run the project using Maven or Gradle:
   ```sh
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

3. Test the REST API endpoints to trigger events (`STANDBY`, `CONNECTING_TO_EX`, `LIVE`) and send messages.

4. Observe the behavior when messages are sent in different states, including message rejection when the state is not `LIVE`.

---

#### **Future Improvements**

- Implement a retry mechanism for rejected messages.
- Add more complex state flows (e.g., error recovery and maintenance modes).
- Integrate with monitoring tools to observe state transitions in real-time.
- Simulate real external dependencies for the `CONNECTING_TO_EX` state.

This concludes the description of the **Spring Boot State Machine Experiment**. This project showcases how to manage states efficiently and apply global validation for message handling in a distributed system.
